# KickBacks

A shoe eccomerce that allows users to make an account and pay for shoes via paypal. Once they have paid for their shoes that can keep track of their order history.

I used MERN technologies to make this a full stack application. For styling I used the React Bootstrap CSS framework, along with other npm packages such as toastify to provide feedback and error handling. For user authentication I used BCryptJs and JSONWebToken.
